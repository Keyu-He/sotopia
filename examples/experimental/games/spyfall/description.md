# Spyfall

## Overview
Spyfall is a social deduction game where all players are at a specific location — except one player, the Spy, who doesn't know where they are. Non-Spies ask each other location-specific questions to identify the Spy (while not making the location too obvious). The Spy must listen, infer the location from the questions, and blend in.

## Players
- Number of players: variable (typically 4-5)
  - 1 Spy (doesn't know the location)
  - Remaining players are Non-Spies (know the location)

## Objective
- **Non-Spies:** Identify and vote out the Spy.
- **Spy:** Figure out the location from context clues and avoid being detected, or survive long enough to guess the location correctly.

## How to Play
Each round alternates between two phases:
1. **Questioning:** Players take turns asking each other yes/no-style questions to probe location knowledge. Questions should demonstrate you know the location without being too obvious (or the Spy will figure it out).
2. **Vote:** All players simultaneously vote for who they think is the Spy. The most-voted player is eliminated.
3. Repeat until win condition is met.

**Win conditions:**
- Non-Spies win: the Spy is voted out.
- Spy wins: survives until parity, or correctly guesses the location.

## Scoring / Payoffs
- Winning team/player: +1.0
- Losing team/player: -1.0

## Our Settings
- Location: "Space Station"
- Spy does not know the location; Non-Spies do
- Action order: round-robin for questioning, simultaneous for vote
- Models: gpt-4o for all agents

## Social Skills Tested
- **Deception:** The Spy must ask believable questions about a location they don't know.
- **Inference:** Non-Spies must identify who is asking suspiciously generic questions.
- **Theory of mind:** The Spy must model what a Non-Spy at that location would plausibly ask/say.
- **Information control:** Non-Spies must be specific enough to prove their identity without revealing the location.
